        <h2>The Assignment</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Kubicle is an e-learning platform and one way our learners upskill on our platform is by watching educational videos. We have already built a simple backend and frontend that serves educational videos to learners. Your assignment is to add extra functionality to this application to satisfy the user story below.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
        Download the following repos and get the initial app up and running</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/virtuosolearning/kubicle-interview-be-rails">kubicle-interview-be-rails</a>
          </li>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Once you have both the frontend and backend running (follow the instructions in the <code>README.md</code> for each repo), navigate to
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          <pre><code>
            http://localhost:3000/library
          </code></pre>
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          to see the existing assignment application. A learner can begin a video but if they navigate away from the page their progress is lost. Your assignment is to record the position of the video when the learner pauses so that when they come back to the video they can resume from the same position.
        </p>
        <h2>User Story</h2>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">
          As a learner in the Kubicle system, I watch training videos in order to increase my skill level in a given subject. I want the system to record how much of each video I have watched when I pause, so I can resume where I left off and monitor my learning progress effectively.
        </p>
        <h4>Acceptance Criteria</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">
          <ul>
            <li>
              The learner should be able to start and pause the video playback.
            </li>
            <li>
              The system should automatically record the timestamp when the learner pauses.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the learner resumes the video, playback should start from the last recorded timestamp.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Out of Scope</h2>
        <p>
          While a production system would obviously include multiple users, you can assume for this assignment there is only one user of the system and they do not need to authenticate.
        </p>
        <h2>Submissions</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          This assignment should only take you a few hours of development time. Feel free to take note of any extra work you would do if you had the time, or any ideas that you think would make the feature better that you would work on if this was a real feature for Kubicle. We can discuss these at your follow on interview where we will discuss how you approached the assignment.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          You can submit the project either by emailing a zip file of the code to us or by posting on a public Github repository that we can view. Please talk to your recruiter or hiring manager for details.
          <p>
            <p class="lead mb-4">
              Good luck!
